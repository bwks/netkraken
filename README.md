# NetKraken

NetKraken is a Network connectivity tester inspired by `nc`, `ncat` and the `netcat`s
of the world.

> # ðŸš§ work in progress ðŸš§

## Goals
 1) Rapidly prove which of the trinity of evil (Network/Firewall/DNS) is causing connectivity issues
 2) Async all the things for massive concurrency
 3) Cross platform support, with Windows as a first class citizen

## Current Features
 - TCP/UDP Client/Server
 - HTTP Client
 - DNS Client
 - Asynchronous servers allowing for large amounts of client connections
 - Asynchronous clients allow for simultaneous connections to multiple destinations

## Planned Features
 - HTTP Server
 - TCP/UDP traceroute
 - Latency, Jitter, Bandwidth measurement
